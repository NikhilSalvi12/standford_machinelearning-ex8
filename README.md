Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
This assignment is completed as per the methods thought by Andrew Ng, in the Machine-Learning course on Coursera.

Languages used:-
* Octave.

Objectives:-
* Estimation of parameters for the given data.
* Selecting of thresold Epsilon using cross-validation set.
* using the fitted model and thresold classify Anomalies.
* Using the given vectorise data compute cost function for Recommender system.
* Adding regularization on the computed Cost function.
